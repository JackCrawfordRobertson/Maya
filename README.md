Maya - Visualising the Climate-Water Connection for Specialists.
</h1>

## Overview
Maya is a transformative web-based platform designed to address the critical challenge of water scarcity exacerbated by climate change. By converting complex environmental data into accessible, design-driven narratives, Maya empowers local stakeholders, international donors, and the broader community with actionable insights. This React-based application uses Gatsby to build a robust website and app framework.

### Project Structure
- **src/data/**: Contains JavaScript files with essential data and a `geojsonData/` subdirectory for GeoJSON data of various localities.
- **src/images/**: Hosts images used across the application.
- **src/pages/**: Includes main components of the application, each corresponding to different features or pages of the app:
  - **Localities/**: Features interactive points for localities.
  - **MainConsolidation/**: Contains the `App.js`, which is the main application file.
  - **Maps/**: Stores map-related components like `BaseMap.js` and `TownBorderMap.js`.

## Background
After extensive research and local engagement in Lebanon, Maya was developed to streamline the communication of intricate water case studies across the Levant. This initiative moves beyond traditional lengthy reports, using design to succinctly communicate the complexities of climate change. The project has demonstrated significant impact, having been effectively utilized in pitches to international donors.

### Key Achievements
- **Initial Testing**: Successfully tested by a local NGO during an international donor pitch.
- **Collaborative Expansion**: Supported by recommendations from The Arab Reform Institute for expansion across the Levant.
- **Sustainable Development Goals**: Aligned with UNSDG6, Maya focuses on sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.
